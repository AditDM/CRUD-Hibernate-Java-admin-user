### Hibernate User Management System

---

### Description
The Hibernate User Management System, crafted by Adit (Codename: Origami), is an advanced application aimed at simplifying the management of user entities within a database. It provides a robust platform for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and incorporates role-based authentication to distinguish between regular users and administrators.

### Key Features

1. **Comprehensive CRUD Operations:** Users can seamlessly create, read, update, and delete user records, ensuring efficient data management.

2. **Role-Based Authentication:** Employing role-based authentication, administrators are empowered with additional privileges such as accessing and managing all user data.

3. **Seamless Hibernate Integration:** Leveraging Hibernate as the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool, the system ensures reliable interaction with the underlying database, enhancing performance and scalability.

4. **Robust Input Validation:** Incorporates robust input validation mechanisms to validate user inputs, maintaining data integrity and security.

5. **Graceful Error Handling:** Implements comprehensive error handling to gracefully manage and communicate errors encountered during runtime, providing a seamless user experience.

### Usage
To utilize the Hibernate User Management System:

1. **Download SQL User Schema:** Users are instructed to download the provided SQL user schema and import it into their preferred database management system.

2. **Update Hibernate Configuration:** Users need to modify the `hibernate.cfg.xml` file according to their specific database settings, ensuring proper connection and configuration.

3. **Run the Application:** The system can be initiated by running the application from the `App.java` file, providing users access to the functionalities offered.

4. **Login or Register:** Users can either log in with existing credentials or register for a new account to begin managing user data.

5. **Perform CRUD Operations:** Upon successful login, regular users can manage their personal information, while administrators have access to additional functionalities to manage user data effectively.

6. **Logout:** Users are encouraged to securely log out of the application after completing their tasks to ensure data security and privacy.

### Getting Started with Contribution
To contribute to the enhancement of the Hibernate User Management System:

1. **Fork the Repository:** Users are prompted to fork the repository to their GitHub account, allowing them to work on the codebase independently.

2. **Clone the Repository:** The forked repository can then be cloned to the user's local machine, enabling them to make necessary changes or improvements.

3. **Commit and Push Changes:** After making modifications to the codebase, users can commit their changes and push them to their GitHub repository.

4. **Create a Pull Request:** Finally, users can create a pull request to merge their changes into the main repository, facilitating collaboration and continuous improvement.
